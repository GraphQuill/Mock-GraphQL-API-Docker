# GraphQuill's Mock GraphQL API
This GraphQL API was created and used for testing during the development of [GraphQuill](https://github.com/oslabs-beta/GraphQuill). GraphQuill is a real-time GraphQL API exploration extension for VSCode.

In an effort to allow other engineers to test out GraphQuill on a mock GraphQL API, we've open-sourced this repo. This project uses a docker instance of **PostgreSQL**.
There is also a locally hosted version that uses PostgreSQL and MongoDB [here](https://github.com/GraphQuill/Mock-GraphQL-API-Local).

---

## Using this GraphQL API
Clone this repo: 

```javascript
git clone https://github.com/GraphQuill/Mock-GraphQL-API.git
```

Within the cloned folder, run the docker-setup script:

```javascript
npm run docker-setup
```

After setting up the docker images, run the docker-compose script to spin up the docker images:

```javascript
npm run docker-compose
```

Your GraphQL API has been setup now and seeded with data from [faker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/faker). Now you can use the [GraphQuill](https://github.com/oslabs-beta/GraphQuill) extension to view the API's schema, send queries or mutations and receive responses, all within VS Code ðŸ˜€
